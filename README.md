# Douyu-Play-Pokemon
My project is starting a live channel on Douyu (chinese twitch). Normally, audiences send messages to the host for chatting. 
I want to use these messages as commands to control my computer to, for an example, play pokermon. This is not a new project. 
Researchers in Carnegie Mellon University started a live channel called “Twitch Play Pokermon” on twitch as a social experiment years ago and created a sensation on the Internet. 
I find this experiment excited and want to do the same thing.
1) Parsed commands from chat room on streaming platform to play Pokémon video game
2) Utilized virtual keyboard in Python to control the video game on my computer
3) Built Python program so that the computer reacted to the chat room commands within 1s of time
4) Coordinated a public presentation about the functions of the project
